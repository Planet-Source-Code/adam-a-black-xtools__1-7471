## XTools


</div>

### Description

a set of activex controls.

The OCX contains 7 controls. There are two

different types of textboxes, two types of checkboxes (one made from scratch and you can either have a cross when it is checked, like in WIN NT or you can have the normal tick)

There is two Command buttons and a label. i have to admit one of the controls isn't mine but the rest are. Most of these controls react with mouse movement to make you program look really great.

You have to try it.

If you were dissapointed with the bugs in the XTickBox control download this new version. I Fixed about 7 bugs in the tickbox and now it works great.
